## Hello! I'm Dany.

I've got a BSc in mathematics, and I've been working as a software developer and researcher in various fields including web, development infrastructure, code quality, algorithmics, and Bitcoin and crypto. I've also been designing and executing technical interviews and assessments processes.

A fuller overview of my resume can be seen on [Linkedin](https://www.linkedin.com/in/danyshaanan/). Some of my older stuff can be seen on [DanyShaanan.com](

I'm open to hear from tech-oriented people who think we might have a good fit ãƒ„
