## Hello! I'm Dany.

I've got a BSc in mathematics, and I've been working as a software developer and researcher in various fields including web, development infrastructure, code quality, algorithmics, and Bitcoin and crypto. I've also been designing and executing technical interviews and assessments processes.

A fuller overview of my resume can be seen on [Linkedin](https://www.linkedin.com/in/danyshaanan/). Some of my older stuff can be seen on [DanyShaanan.com](

In the last few years I've been mainly focused on cryptocurrency research and on improving the software development experience by executing recruiting processes and by guiding individuals and teams of software engineers.

I'm currently open to exploring my next opportunities and challenges, aiming at those things and beyond.

If you are an engineer, researcher, or manager and finds this interesting, drop me an email ãƒ„
